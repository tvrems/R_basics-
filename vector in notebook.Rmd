vector-objects that contains set of values called its elements. along with {r} if we give echo=FALSE, we wont get code in the R markdown output. if you dont give anything, it will take it as TRUE.

## numeric vector

```{r}
x=c(1,2,3,4,5)
y=mean(x)
y
r=c(1,NA,3)
s=mean(r)
s
s=mean(r,na.rm=TRUE)
s
x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
sum(x[c(2,3)])
```
## character vector

```{r}
x=c("love","care","love","anger")
table(x)
```
